# Changelog

See the [releases for Conjugate-iOS](https://github.com/scribe-org/Conjugate-iOS/releases) for an up to date list of versions and their release dates. Versions that are marked as released may yet to be in the App Store if it's within the 48 hour submission review period.

Conjugate-iOS tries to follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/), a MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH version where increments are made of the:

- MAJOR version when we make incompatible API changes
- MINOR version when we add functionality in a backwards compatible manner
- PATCH version when we make backwards compatible bug fixes

Emojis for the following are chosen based on [gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev/).

# Conjugate-iOS 1.0.0
